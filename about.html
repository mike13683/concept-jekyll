                    <p>Formed by 9 large independently owned Security installers based around the UK via 12 branches. This group enables us to provide not just quality installations but more importantly a quality after-sales services.</p>
                    <p>This group provides the client with an alternative to dealing with large faceless national companies. National account clients will be given a dedicated account manager usually appointed from the nearest local branch member. Unless you have a relationship built already with another member - in this case that will remain unchanged.</p>
                    <p class="d-none d-sm-block">The dedicated account manager will then liaise behind the scenes with all relevant group members regarding all service and installation matters.</p>

                            <p>I formed Concept back in 2002 and I have witnessed growth year on year since then.

                            <p>I joined Concept (the family business) upon leaving school in 2011 and started out as an installation apprentice. I have gained an array of skills & experience working within the commercial industrial and domestic systems to name a few. I moved into the office as Service Co-Ordinator in 2015, quickly establishing myself as Key Account Manager to several of our National Accounts.</p>
                            <p class="d-none d-sm-block">With a strong work ethic I strive to be as efficient as possible and thrive on the opportunity to learn new skills daily. I love spending time with my family and also play rugby for a local team on weekends. I love socialising and my hospitality skills are stuff of legend, I’ve been told.</p>
