                    <h3>Restricting Access for staff, visitors, contractors and patients</h3>
                    <p>If you need to restrict access to sensitive parts of your site, or just control and monitor who has access to different areas then there are a wide range of systems available. These can be stand-alone, or linked to software to track movements and if necessary alert the necessary people. They include swipe and proximity card systems and the latest fingerprint technology.</p>

                    <p>Our cost effective and reliable Security Gates, Barriers & Turnstiles perfectly suit commercial, public or private premises. We have an extensive range of Manual Barrier, Automatic Arm Barriers and Swing Gates, all tried and tested to deliver reliable long term great entry barriers.</p>
                    <p>You may be looking to find ways of restricting access to your site to those who need to be there, for example where unauthorised visitors are using your car park, as a first line of security. Arm barriers are an ideal way of securing large perimeters, allowing pedestrian access whilst denying vehicle entry.</p>

                    <p>We offer half and full height Turnstile Gates that can be single or bidirectional when in operation. The turnstile and motorised gates can be operated by whoever is cleared to pass through the gate or from a remote location.</p>
                    <p>Mechanised gates would allow dismounted cyclists to pass through the gates, if authorised. The cyclist passes through the turnstile. Once the turnstile rotor has completed its rotation it automatically locks. The gate remains open for a longer duration, allowing the bicycle to clear the gate.</p>
