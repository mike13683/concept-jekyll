                        <li>Convenience - you will have the ability to view your CCTV network from any location.</li>
                        <li>Additional Cameras - Cameras can be easily added to the existing network.</li>
                        <li>Remote assistance - we can remotely access, to resolve any technical problems.</li>

                    <p>HD CCTV is a new broadcast quality technology that will enable the CCTV industry to bring HD quality images to their customers.</p>
                    <p>Unlike IP CCTV, the existing coax infrastructure can be used, no new cabling is required to upgrade from analogue to HD.</p>
                    <p>The UK has a huge existing infrastructure of coax installed and it is only now that by using HD CCTV that this coax can be utilised to bring high quality HD images into the world of CCTV without huge costs involved to upgrade to IP.</p>
