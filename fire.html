                    <p>In the event of a fire, of course your major concern is the safety of your people.  But fire is also the ultimate threat to the integrity and ongoing function of your business premises and the products or services you provide and these days, with a combination of commercial pressures and legislation, it's even more important to take the right preventative measures.</p>
                    <p>Fire safety rules require all non-domestic buildings to complete a full fire risk assessment. The more complex your building is, the more likely you are to need the input of someone with comprehensive training and experience to keep your property safe.</p>
