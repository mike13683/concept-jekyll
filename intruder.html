                    <p>Fitting an Intruder Alarm System is a fast route to peace of mind - and lower insurance premiums. By deterring criminals from even attempting to target your premises and interrupting them if they do, they protect your business from the cost and disruption theft causes.</p>
                    <p>Not only do we have many years of proven experience specifying and installing systems and making sure they work, we are also completely independent. That means when it comes to recommending equipment, we don't have hidden agendas.</p>

                            <p class="d-none d-sm-block">We use <a href="https://www.csl-group.com/uk/products/emizon-tcd.html">Emizon’s Telemetry Communications Device (TCD)</a> to monitor your Alarm System. The TCD is the communications hardware device in the control panel providing the gateway to the Emizon IP service. The TCD establishes secure IP connections through the customer router/firewall for both the primary path; using the wired IP network, and the secondary path, using O2, EE and Vodafone’s GPRS wireless network, to the ARC, across the Emizon Service Platform.</p>

                    <p>Smoke Cloak will fill an area with a very dense artificial fog reducing visibility to zero, disorientating any intruders.</p>

                        <li>Smoke Cloak is an excellent deterrent, as the Intruder can’t steal what he can’t see</li>
